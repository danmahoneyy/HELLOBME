<p>BME is my major and making a positive mark on this world is my mission.  I'm learning so many new things and this is one of them so I made this website to talk about all things BME!</p>
<body>
<p>I am a first year student at THE Stony Brook University, and my dream is to help those who have been paralyzed be able to move again through biomedical engineering.</p>

<p>My favorite class so far was BME100. Not only was I inspired to continue pursuing my dream, but I got in A in the class AND my team and I won best presentation for our poster project!  It was exciting and I truly enjoyed everything we did!</p>
<p>Here is a picture of my team and I after the big win!</p>
